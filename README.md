# Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent online payment transactions using the PaySim dataset.

## 📌 Overview

Online payment fraud is a major financial risk in digital finance.  
This project builds a Random Forest–based classification system capable of identifying fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Label Encoding of transaction types
- Stratified Train-Test Split
- SMOTE for class imbalance handling
- Random Forest model training
- Confusion matrix evaluation
- Feature importance analysis

## 📊 Dataset

- PaySim Synthetic Financial Dataset  
- Contains millions of mobile money transactions  
- Highly imbalanced fraud detection problem

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Imbalanced-learn  
- Seaborn & Matplotlib  
- Google Colab
